# Ad-Tracker

JS based web crawler built to test and measure the quantity of cookies and scripts a browser instance interacts with on two conditions - one without any sort of Ad blocking and one with an Ad blocker extension installed and enabled within the instance.

The current websites being tested are CNN, Youtube, ESPN, and StockX, as specified in 'data/urls.json'.
